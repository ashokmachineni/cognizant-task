# cognizant-task
Project developed using Kotlin,retrofit,room db,mvvm,koin di

I developed this app using Kotlin and Mvvm Architecture.
Libraries Used:
• Retrofit 2.0
• Room db
• Okhttp
• DataBinding
• ViewModel
• Coroutines and Koin for Di

When we open the app initially, data from api will load and display it in HomeScreen in recyclerview and at the same time it will store offline using Roomdb.

 I added Unit test and Instrumentation test cases for this app. 
 
 I added Sort by title option button in Options menu,When user click on it ,will display order by title.
 
 Future Improvements:
•	We can implement swipe to right feature to each item in recyclerview to add delete or add to favorites.
•	We can implement different colors to each row.
•	Add favorites features and  by using bottom nav menu display home screen to show data from api/offline db and fav menu to display favorite items.
•	We can add dark and light themes to app and we can put an option to choose theme.
•	 We can Add animations while app loading, splashscreen, shimmereffect etc.
